# CineBot-Web

This is a full-stack movie search and streaming application, generated by an AI based on a detailed project specification.

## Project Structure

- `/` (root): Contains the React (Vite) frontend application.
- `/backend`: Contains the Node.js (Express) backend server.

Each directory is a separate project with its own `package.json` and dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- A MongoDB Atlas account and a database cluster.

## Setup & Running

### Backend

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`.
    - `cp .env.example .env`
    - Edit `.env` and fill in your MongoDB URI (`MONGO_URI`) and the frontend origin (`FRONTEND_ORIGIN`, e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

4.  **Populate your database:**
    - Connect to your MongoDB cluster.
    - Create a database (e.g., `cinebot`) and a collection named `files`.
    - Insert documents matching the schema provided in the project specification.
    - **Crucially**, for the download/stream feature to work, you must place corresponding files in a `/backend/uploads` directory. Each file should be named with its MongoDB `_id` (without any extension).

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend server will be running on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: `http://localhost:8000`).

### Frontend

1.  **Navigate to the root directory (if you were in `/backend`):**
    ```sh
    cd ..
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`.
    - `cp .env.example .env`
    - The default `VITE_API_BASE_URL` should point to your backend server (`http://localhost:8000`). Adjust if needed.

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## Deployment

Follow the deployment guides provided in the original project specification for deploying the backend to a service like Render and the frontend to Vercel/Netlify. Remember to set the environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard.
